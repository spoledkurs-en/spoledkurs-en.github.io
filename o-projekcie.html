  <p>EduCoop's activities focus on supporting open education in Polish schools and libraries. We want to restore the spirit of cooperation among teachers, educators and library employees.</p>
  <p>We want the participants of our projects to rediscover the value and pleasure of joint creation and learning through experience. We focus on the exchange of knowledge and mutual support. Teaching should be an adventure during which people with diverse worldviews and experiences meet, boldly face reality, think creatively and creatively. Thanks to this, they have space to create creative and high-quality open educational resources.</p>
   
    <strong>Why was EduCoop created?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">that teachers and librarians could learn how to work and develop open education;</li>
      <li class="bullet">to create reference open educational resources;</li>
      <li class="bullet">to connect people who think similarly about education, they want cooperation, accessibility and openness in education.</li>
    </ul>  
    <p><strong>History</p></strong>

<p>The Open Education Cooperative project was created 3 years ago (in 2018) for the needs of open education activities conducted for the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
At that time, mathematics teachers, tutors and librarians took part. A dozen or so model open resources and two online courses were created.
  Around the idea of SpołEd there is a group of teachers - EduCoop Leaders. </p>

    <strong>Meethod</strong>
    <p>Below you will find a description of the cycle of work with SpołEd participants. We present it step by step, giving insight into the whole process.</p>
    <p><strong>1) For whom:</strong></p>
    <p>The original version of the project is intended for teachers from various types of schools at every educational stage. However, along with its development, it also went to librarians and educators. The workshop group is no more than 15 people. We work with people who are ready to change their way of teaching, open to new technologies and modern teaching methods. We also care about the atmosphere of cooperation and mutual support. That is why we select participants in a two-stage recruitment process:<br>
Online survey - candidates complete a short survey in which they describe basic information about themselves.<br>
From the volunteers, we choose a group of teachers who are asked to send us a form in which they describe their experiences and motivations for work. If at this stage we have doubts as to whether a person will be suitable for our group, we conduct an additional telephone conversation.</br>

This recruitment method gives us greater confidence that the participants will be guided by similar values and that our project will meet their expectations.
Thanks to this, we can also adapt the workshop program to the individual needs of participants.
