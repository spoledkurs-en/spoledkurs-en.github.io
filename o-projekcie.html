  <p>EduCoop's activities focus on supporting open education in Polish schools and libraries. We want to restore the spirit of cooperation among teachers, educators and library employees.</p>
  <p>We want the participants of our projects to rediscover the value and pleasure of joint creation and learning through experience. We focus on the exchange of knowledge and mutual support. Teaching should be an adventure during which people with diverse worldviews and experiences meet, boldly face reality, think creatively and creatively. Thanks to this, they have space to create creative and high-quality open educational resources.</p>

    <strong>Why was EduCoop created?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">that teachers and librarians could learn how to work and develop open education;</li>
      <li class="bullet">to create reference open educational resources;</li>
      <li class="bullet">to connect people who think similarly about education, they want cooperation, accessibility and openness in education.</li>
    </ul>  
    <p><strong>History</p></strong>

<p>The Open Education Cooperative project was created 3 years ago (in 2018) for the needs of open education activities conducted for the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
At that time, mathematics teachers, tutors and librarians took part. A dozen or so model open resources and two online courses were created.
  Around the idea of SpołEd there is a group of teachers - EduCoop Leaders. </p>
