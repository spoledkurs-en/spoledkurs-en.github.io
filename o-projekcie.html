  <p>EduCoop's activities focus on supporting open education in Polish schools and libraries. We want to restore the spirit of cooperation among teachers, educators and library employees.</p>
  <p>We want the participants of our projects to rediscover the value and pleasure of joint creation and learning through experience. We focus on the exchange of knowledge and mutual support. Teaching should be an adventure during which people with diverse worldviews and experiences meet, boldly face reality, think creatively and creatively. Thanks to this, they have space to create creative and high-quality open educational resources.</p>
