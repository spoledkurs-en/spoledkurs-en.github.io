  One of our basic values at EduCoop is collaboration. The project motto (inspired by our first math-oriented edition) is “We multiply by adding, and add to multiply.” During in-person events, our participants always work in groups. We encourage you to create your own networks and groups to share and create – multiplying wisdom and sharing it! You can join one of existing groups, for example: <a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/resources/toolkitsforschools/subarea.cfm?sa=9">https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/resources/toolkitsforschools/subarea.cfm?sa=9</a>.

If you don’t know how to even start looking for people with similar interests, or prefer to join a pre-existing group, write to us: <br/> spoled@centrumcyfrowe.pl
