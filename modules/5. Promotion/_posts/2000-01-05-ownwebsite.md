How to create your own website

  <p>
To create your own website, it’s best to use a website builder. We recommend using one of two: <a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wix.com/">wix.com</a> and <a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.weebly.com/?lang=en">weebly</a>.<br/>
Both are simple to use; there are plenty of tutorials available to help you with your first steps.

  If you decide to run a blog, we propose choosing:
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <ul>
<li class="bullet"> <a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> - gives the option of creating your own domain, is free, and can be connected to your Google account.</li>
<li class="bullet"><a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/">medium</a> - medium – a website to upload your own texts, designed similarly to social media, which means the texts are ascribed to the author, not the website (since you don’t have your own domain), but you don’t have any formatting options. It’s an interesting option, since the site is rather new and modern.</li>
 </ul>
