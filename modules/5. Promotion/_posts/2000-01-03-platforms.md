  In Poland, there does not exist a central database for open educational resources, though you can find one in <a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.klascement.net/?hl=en"> Belgium </a> and <a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://ndla.no/">Norway</a>. There are also materials in English there, so we suggest using them.

   Currently, we have to work without that level of support, though it’s not necessarily a hurdle; it can also be a chance for ours to make our own choices as to where we’ll publish open educational resources. And that’s what we encourage you to do! Of course, creating a blog, website, or cloud-based drive requires time and effort. It may also end up bringing a lot of benefits. You’ll have all your materials ready in one place, they’ll be easier to access, and easier to share with others.
