  Thank you for taking part in our course! We sincerely hope that it has helped you learn about open educational resources, open education and – most importantly – that it has sparked a desire to bring these ideas to your school.

During the course, we wanted to show you different educational methods and tools that are used during in-person learning. As you might have noticed, that’s only a fragment of what’s possible with educational resources. Our course will continue to develop and change alongside EduCoop, so we encourage you to revisit our site in a while.
