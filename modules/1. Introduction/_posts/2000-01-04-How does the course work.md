How does the course work?
</div>


<div class="screen-content">
  <p>We want to share with you the information we’ve amassed about open educational resources through years of experience and cooperation with teachers and specialists from different fields.<br/>
The course is based on materials created through EduCoop, as well as Centrum Cyfrowe’s other projects.<br/>
An important tenet of open education is sharing and using existing resources; it’s part of the cycle of information, which is why we gladly turn to materials already available on the Internet, and encourage you to read, download, and remix resources for you own needs as well.</p> 
<p>The course contents are available to all interested, without the need to register. The course contains quizzes and tests.</p>
  
  &nbsp;
  
  <p><strong>Course subject matter:</strong></p>  
  <p>We want this course to support the creation of additional open educational resources, as well as to present a new approach to education. When it came to building an online course and designing EduCoop’s purpose and purview, the most important quality for us was teamwork and collaboration. This is why we focus not only on resources, but also on the method of their creation. We care about creating a pleasant process that encourages personal development and feelings of satisfaction.</p>

&nbsp;
  
  <p><strong>Course target audience:</strong></p>  
  <p>The course is first and foremost designed for K-12 teachers, but it can be useful for those in other professions, as well as students, university-level professors, and librarians.</p>

&nbsp;

<p><strong>Time:</strong></p>  
  <p>The course is designed to be completed over six weeks. Reading and completing the assignments in a module shouldn’t take more than three hours (the assignment in module 5 may be more time consuming than the rest).</p>
  
  &nbsp;
  
  <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>  
  <p>The course is divided into six modules. The first and last modules are organizational in nature. The other content-driven modules contain an optional assignment. After the last module, the assignment is to create your own open educational resource.</p>
