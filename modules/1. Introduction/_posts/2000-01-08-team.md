  <p>Our course came about thanks to the work of the whole team. Its existence is owed to the hard work of Centrum Cyfrowe workers: Magdalena Biernat, Aleksandra Czetwerty≈Ñska, and Katarzyna Werner, as well as our collaborators, who created the texts and lectures.

<p>The EduCoop team included: Dorota Orzeszek, our specialist in accessibility, Marcin Mitzner and his team at Games Development, who are to thank for the topics related to educational games, Dirk Uys from <a class="content-link" href="https://www.p2pu.org/en/">P2PU </a> who created <a class="content-link" href="https://howto.p2pu.org/">&bdquo;Course in a box&rdquo;</a>, which our own course is based upon.</p>
