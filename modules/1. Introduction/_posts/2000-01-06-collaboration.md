<p>Statistics say that an average of 10% of people completes the online learning courses they sign up for. The reasons range from a lack of interaction between participants to a lack of motivation. We’d like this course to be different, which is why we encourage you to treat this course as an opportunity to meet new teachers and find support, not just as an individual way of acquiring knowledge: when you’re creating educational resources, remember to invite other teachers from your school or social media to collaborate with you,  if you prefer to write alone, ask a  kind, generous colleague to give feedback on your work and offer suggestions.</p>
  <p>One of the fundamental values of the Open Educational Cooperative is collaboration, and we want to strongly encourage you to try it out!

  <p>Don’t forget to ask your students’ opinions as well, as they maybe have a completely different perspective on your educational materials.</p>
