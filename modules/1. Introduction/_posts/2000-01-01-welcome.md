  <p>We sincerely welcome you to the course, created by EduCoop Open Education Cooperative.</p> 
<p>“Open Education in Practice” is a course that will take you step-by-step through the world of open education and resources. You’ll learn about existing educational resources and tools that will facilitate the creation of your own materials; you’ll also learn about the licenses that enable you to upload to the Internet, as well as the methods used at Centrum Cyfrowe. We encourage you to create your resources collaboratively, with other teachers or curious allies. And most importantly, we encourage you to enjoy the experience.</p>
