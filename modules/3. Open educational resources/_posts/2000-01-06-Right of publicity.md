Right of publicity

  <p>
 If you want to use images or films while creating your own educational resources, and these images contain the face of a third party (such as your students or friends from work), you must remember about the right of publicity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <ol>
<strong><li class="number">What is necessary to publish an image with someone’s face in it under a free license?
</li></strong>
    <p>You must own the copyright for the image, and the permission of the person whose face is contained in the photo. Permission is not required in three cases:
</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="number">when the person received monetary compensation for their image and did not forbid publishing;</li>
      <li class="number">when the person contained in the image is well-known, and their image was captured during a public event, especially political, social, or professional;
</li>
      <li class="number">when the person is only one part of a larger group, landscape, or public event.</li>
      <p>To use the image of children (minors), written person is required from the parent (legal guardian). </p>
    </ol>
    <strong><li class="number">What is the relationship between right of publicity and the ability to publish photographs on a free license?</li></strong>
    <p>CC licenses don’t include permission to disseminate an image. So, publishing a portrait on a free license requires the permission of the person, unless it is one of the above cases. </p>
    <strong><li class="number">Who needs to collect permission for publication from people taking part in an event or work party?</li></strong>
    <p>In the case of a party, permission to publish the photographs should be obtained by the organizer. Permission is not needed for group or crowd shots (such as at a concert). Permission is required for individual portraits or close photographs of a few people.

</ol>
