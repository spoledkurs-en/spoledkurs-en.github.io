  <p>
 In the previous module, you described a lesson and the tools you used to prepare it. In this module, we’ll go a step further:
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <ol>
<li class="number">Describe, as you see fit, a selected exercise – using names, last names, initials, or pseudonyms; you can also give it a title or name.</li>
<li class="number">Add a selected free license to your exercise and think about why you chose this particular license.</li>
<li class="number">Check if your created resource fits the requirements for openness. If not, write down what needs to look different or what needs changing. If you want, make these changes.</li>
</ol>
  </p>
  
  <p>
 You don’t have to work on the same exercise as the one from module one – you can pick a different one, or write something brand new.
  </p>
&nbsp;

<p>
We invite you to play around. Can you find all the key words that relate to open educational resources?
