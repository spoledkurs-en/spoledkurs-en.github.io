Introduction

<div class="screen-content">
  <p>In the previous module, we discussed changes in education and new teaching methods. We pointed out that without collaboration, new technologies, and the spirit of adventure, open education would be much more difficult and boring. In this module we’ll discuss what <strong>open educational resources</strong>are. 
</p>
  
  <p>To learn more, it’s worth looking back at the beginnings of the open education movement.</p>
  
  <p>The beginning of consolidated thought about openness can be traced back to the Open Society Foundation’s <a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.capetowndeclaration.org/read-the-declaration">Cape Town Open Education Declaration</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
<a class="content-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.capetowndeclaration.org/read-the-declaration">The Cape Town Declaration</a> was signed over 10 years ago, and since then, organizations across the world have been working to introduce and expand openness across a variety of subjects related to education. And we encourage you to join us!
